## Overview



## Reporting a bug

Read the instructions below before you create a bug report.

 1. Search the [OpenCart forum](http://forum.opencart.com/viewforum.php?f=191), ask the community if they have seen the bug or know how to fix it.
 2. Check all open and closed issues on the [GitHub bug tracker](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues).
 3. If your bug is related to the OpenCart core code then please create a bug report on GitHub.
 4. READ the [changelog for the master branch](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/master/changelog.md)
 5. Use [Google](http://www.google.com) to search for your issue.
 6. Make sure that your bug/issue is not related to your hosting environment.

If you are not sure about your issue, it is always best to ask the community on our [bug forum thread](http://forum.opencart.com/viewforum.php?f=191)

**Important!**
- If your bug report is not related to the core code (such as a 3rd party module or your server configuration) then the issue will be closed without a reason. You must contact the extension developer, use the forum or find a commercial partner to resolve a 3rd party code issue.
- If you would like to report a serious security bug please PM an OpenCart moderator/administrator on the forum. Please do not report concept/ideas/unproven security flaws - all security reports are taken seriously but you must include the EXACT details steps to reproduce it. Please DO NOT post security flaws in a public location.





If a bug is found in an announced developer release that is significant (such as a major feature is broken) then the release will be pulled. A patch version will be issued to replace it, depending on the severity of the patch an extended testing period may be announced. If the developer release version was never made public then the preceding patch version tag will be removed.

To receive developer notifications about release information, sign up to the newsletter on the [OpenCart website](http://www.opencart.com) - located in the footer. Then choose the developer news option.
